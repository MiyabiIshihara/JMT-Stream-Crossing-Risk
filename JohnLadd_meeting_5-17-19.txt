Call with John Ladd 5/17/19

Spreadsheet of all entry and exit trailheads
	- John working on same thing, probably some stuff that's duplicated
	- Chester has entry and exits, junctions, and both JMT mileage and total mileage
	- Potentially remove some of the trailheads that people use to game the system

App demonstration
	- Connect with Elizabeth Wenk (now in Australia) to double check that 
	- People who are starting early/late and could potentially take photos of all the crossings
		- One straight across the stream, one upstream, one downstream
	- Something to resolve overlap of watersheds: only show one watershed at a time
	- Being able to click on stream crossing to select it
	- Remove certain trailheads that encourage people to game the permit system
	- Automatically update end date when changing start date
	- Snow data product? Check with Laurel
		- Switch to using MODIS snow cover?
		- John Ladd knows someone using it
	- More narrative description of what plots are showing (red line and gray box)
	- Correction factor for elevation of upstream watersheds? 
		- Snow is melting off too early in the year
	- John supportive of publicizing it, but just wants to ensure uncertainty is appropriately communicated
