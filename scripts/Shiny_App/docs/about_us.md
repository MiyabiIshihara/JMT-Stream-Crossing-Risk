### Stream Crossing Risks 

Risks along the John Muir Trail (JMT) can range from non-existent to life-threatening. In particular, hazardous stream crossings claimed the lives of multiple through hikers in 2017. Current approaches to avoiding high-risk stream crossings rely on hikers seeking out, gathering, and interpreting anecdotal data from various message boards, social media pages, and word of mouth. Potential hikers who do not have strong social networks with other hikers, substantial hiking experience, or substantial geophysical expertise, may have difficulty properly assessing and planning for stream crossing safety.

### Project Partner and Our Goal

To get a holistic understanding of the prevalence and severity of on-trail risks, a retired San Francisco lawyer John Ladd has been administering an annual online survey of hikers since 2013. The survey contains hiker information and ratings of various challenges that they experienced during the trip. 

Our goal is to provide a webmap dashboard that acts as a nexus for multiple types of crossing information. As a user, you can: 

* Plan trip schedule 
* Visualize historical and current streamflow risk
* Access crossing descriptions and photographs
* Identify alternative safer routes

### Data
We use the following data to analyze and build the webmap: 

+ **JMT Hiker Survey** contains hiker attributes, trip dates and trailheads, and stream crossing ratings. The survey is collected by John Ladd. 

+ **Topographic Maps**
  - JMT network, by  _[ArcGIS](http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=44a5cf4b72cb4b7e8564183920b1c8b5)_.  
  - Stream network, by  _[CalFish](https://www.calfish.org/ProgramsData/ReferenceLayersHydrography/CaliforniaHydrography.aspx)_
  - Watersheds, by _[Wyoming Geographic Information Sciences Center](https://geodata.lib.berkeley.edu/catalog/stanford-sr396hp9621)_

+ **Meteorological data**
  - Spatially complete daily measurements of **temperature and precipitation**, by the _[PRISM Climate Group](http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/)_.  
  - Spatially complete daily measurements of **snow cover**, by  _[MODIS](https://nsidc.org/data/modis/data_summaries)_.  

+ **Crossing Descriptions** 
  - Guidebooks
