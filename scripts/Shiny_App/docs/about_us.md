### Partner and Problem

Risks along the John Muir Trail (JMT) can range from non-existent to life-threatening; hazardous stream crossings claimed the lives of multiple through hikers in 2017. Current approaches to avoiding high-risk stream crossings rely on hikers seeking out, gathering, and interpreting anecdotal data from various message boards, social media pages, and word of mouth. Potential hikers who do not have strong social networks with other hikers, substantial hiking experience, or substantial geophysical expertise, may have difficulty properly assessing and planning for stream crossing safety.

John Ladd administers the annual JMT Survey. It contains hiker information and ratings of various challenges that they experienced during the trip.

Our goal is to communicate how meteorological conditions may affect stream crossing risk. Specifically, 

1. Identify stream crossings that pose a safety risk to backpacker
2. Forecast risk
3. Provide options to mitigate the risk
